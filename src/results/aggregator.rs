/// The function aggregates the scraped results from the user-selected upstream search engines.
/// These engines can be chosen either from the user interface (UI) or from the configuration file.
/// The code handles this process by matching the selected search engines and adding them to a vector.
/// This vector is then used to create an asynchronous task vector using `tokio::spawn`, which returns
/// a future. This future is awaited in another loop. Once the results are collected, they are filtered
/// to remove any errors and ensure only proper results are included. If an error is encountered, it is
/// sent to the UI along with the name of the engine and the type of error. This information is finally
/// placed in the returned `SearchResults` struct.
///
/// Additionally, the function eliminates duplicate results. If two results are identified as coming from
/// multiple engines, their names are combined to indicate that the results were fetched from these upstream
/// engines. After this, all the data in the `HashMap` is removed and placed into a struct that contains all
/// the aggregated results in a vector. Furthermore, the query used is also added to the struct. This step is
/// necessary to ensure that the search bar in the search remains populated even when searched from the query URL.
///
/// Overall, this function serves to aggregate scraped results from user-selected search engines, handling errors,
/// removing duplicates, and organizing the data for display in the UI.
///
/// # Example:
///
/// If you search from the url like `https://127.0.0.1/search?q=huston` then the search bar should
/// contain the word huston and not remain empty.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `query` - Accepts a string to query with the above upstream search engines.
/// * `page` - Accepts an u32 page number.
/// * `random_delay` - Accepts a boolean value to add a random delay before making the request.
/// * `debug` - Accepts a boolean value to enable or disable debug mode option.
/// * `upstream_search_engines` - Accepts a vector of search engine names which was selected by the
/// * `request_timeout` - Accepts a time (secs) as a value which controls the server request timeout.
/// user through the UI or the config file.
///
/// # Error
///
/// Returns an error a reqwest and scraping selector errors if any error occurs in the results
/// function in either `searx` or `duckduckgo` or both otherwise returns a `SearchResults struct`
/// containing appropriate values.

    // The code block `outputs.iter()` determines whether it is the first time the code is being run.
    // It does this by checking the initial flag. If it is the first time, the code selects the first
    // engine from which results are fetched and adds or extends them into the `result_map`. If the
    // initially selected engine fails, the code automatically selects another engine to map or extend
    // into the `result_map`. On the other hand, if an engine selected for the first time successfully
    // fetches results and maps them into the `result_map`, the initial flag is set to false. Subsequently,
    // the code iterates through the remaining engines one by one. It compares the fetched results from each
    // engine with the results already present in the `result_map` to identify any duplicates. If duplicate
    // results are found, the code groups them together with the name of the engine from which they were
    // fetched, and automatically removes the duplicate results from the newly fetched data.
    //
    // Additionally, the code handles errors returned by the engines. It keeps track of which engines
    // encountered errors and stores this information in a vector of structures called `EngineErrorInfo`.
    // Each structure in this vector contains the name of the engine and the type of error it returned.
    // These structures will later be added to the final `SearchResults` structure. The `SearchResults`
    // structure is used to display an error box in the UI containing the relevant information from
    // the `EngineErrorInfo` structure.
    //
    // In summary, this code block manages the selection of engines, handling of duplicate results, and tracking
    // of errors in order to populate the `result_map` and provide informative feedback to the user through the
    // `SearchResults` structure.
